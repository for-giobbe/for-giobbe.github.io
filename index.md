Hi there! I am an evolutionary biologist, currently a post-doc at University of Milan, Italy. I am interested in studying how trait evolve, leveraging different perspective such as macroevolutionary and genomics/trascriptomics approaches. 

Here is my [twitter](https://twitter.com/fornigiobbe) and [github](https://github.com/for-giobbe)

Here is also my [scholar profile](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=xXrCOhAAAAAJ&hl=en) but here's a list of the papers I enjoyed the most:

- [mitochondrial phylogenomics of Euphasmatodea supports a Triassic/Jurassic radiation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1055790320302554)

- reversible and dynamic evolution of wings in phasmids

- pleiotropy constrain trascriptional and sequence changes after trait loss

- morphological stasis is not mirrored at the genome evolution level in notostraca
