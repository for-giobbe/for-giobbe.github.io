Hi there! I am an evolutionary biologist / bioinformatician, currently a post-doc at University of Bologna, Italy.

I am interested in studying how different traits evolve and the interplay between the phenotipical level and the underlying molecular one.
To do so I leverage different frameworks such as phylogenetic comparative methods, RNA-seq and genomes.

Take a look at my [twitter](https://twitter.com/fornigiobbe) and [github](https://github.com/for-giobbe)!

This is my [scholar profile](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=xXrCOhAAAAAJ&hl=en), but here's a list of the papers I enjoyed the most:

- [Euphasmatodea mtgens supports a Triassic/Jurassic radiation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1055790320302554)

- [Reversible and dynamic evolution of complex trait](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/sysbio/syac038/6605864)

- Pleiotropy constrain gene modifications after trait loss (WIP)

- [Morphological stasis not mirrored in genome evolution](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2021.11.001)

- [Custom tool to ease the use of codon models in genomics](https://github.com/for-giobbe/BASE)

- [_Reticultiermes speratus_genome](https://doi.org/10.1111/imb.12818)

- [A novel and exciting genus of Australian stick insect is described](https://doi.org/10.1093/zoolinnean/zlac074)

- [A hidden microbial war](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2216922120)

- Shared signatures of the shifts to endosymbiosis across Enterobacterales (WIP)

- A phylogenetic approach to eDNAbaits design (WIP)

- Diseecting the molecular groundplan of an ant-plant interaction (WIP)

Societies I like and I am a member of: ESEB/SIBE/SSE/SSB/SMBE/TSA.

I also enjoy a wide range of [music](https://madteo.bandcamp.com/track/rugrats-dont-techno-for-an-answer).
