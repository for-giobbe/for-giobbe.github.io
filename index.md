Hi there! I am an evolutionary biologist / bioinformatitian, currently a post-doc at University of Milan, Italy.

I am interested in studying how different traits evolve and the interplay between the phenotipical level and the underlying genomic/trascriptomic one.
To do so I leverage different frameworks such as phylogenetic comparative methods, RNA-seq and whole genome sequencing. 

Here is my [twitter](https://twitter.com/fornigiobbe) and [github](https://github.com/for-giobbe)

Here is also my [scholar profile](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=xXrCOhAAAAAJ&hl=en) but here's a list of the papers I enjoyed the most:

- [mitochondrial phylogenomics of Euphasmatodea supports a Triassic/Jurassic radiation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1055790320302554)

- [reversible and dynamic evolution of complex trait](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.14.336354v1.abstract)

- pleiotropy constrain trascriptional and sequence changes after trait loss

- morphological stasis is not mirrored at the genome evolution level
