Hi there! I am an evolutionary biologist / bioinformatician, currently a post-doc at University of Milan, Italy.

I am interested in studying how different traits evolve and the interplay between the phenotipical level and the underlying molecular one.
To do so I leverage different frameworks such as phylogenetic comparative methods, RNA-seq and genomes.

I am currently working on exploring the molecular groundplan of an ant - plant interaction.

Take a look at my [twitter](https://twitter.com/fornigiobbe) and [github](https://github.com/for-giobbe)

This is my [scholar profile](https://scholar.google.it/citations?user=xXrCOhAAAAAJ&hl=en), but here's a list of the papers I enjoyed the most:

- [Euphasmatodea mtgens supports a Triassic/Jurassic radiation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1055790320302554)

- [reversible and dynamic evolution of complex trait](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.10.14.336354v1.abstract)

- pleiotropy constrain expression and sequence changes after trait loss

- [morphological stasis is not mirrored at the genome evolution level](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygeno.2021.11.001)

Societies I like: ESEB/SIBE/SSE/SSB/SMBE.

I also enjoy a wide range of [music](https://madteo.bandcamp.com/track/rugrats-dont-techno-for-an-answer).
